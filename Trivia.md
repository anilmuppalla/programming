#### What is swapping? 

Swapping is a simple memory/process management technique used by an 
operating system to increase processor utilization by moving some blocked process from the main memory to the secondary memory. The execution continues with the newly arrived process. After performing the swapping process, the operating system has two options in selecting a process for execution :
 * Operating System can admit newly created process
 * Operating system can activate suspended process from the swap memory.
